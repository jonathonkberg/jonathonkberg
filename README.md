# Welcome to my page

## Intro
I am Jonathon, and I am an electrical engineering graduate student who has experience working on systems with embedded computers. My focuses include those with electronic hardware and firmware, control systems, system design, among others. I am ends focused rather than means focused because engineering without ends can only be vanity. I try to encapsulate beauty in all of my projects since I am more philosophical than your average engineer. I enjoy seeing various components operating in beautiful order, and I do not limit myself to one area of electrical engineering in order that I could experience the flavor of each of these areas.

## Skills
* C/C++, Matlab, python, some markdown/markup
* Have worked with: Linux based systems, PIC, esp8266/32, arduino, Risc-V dev board
* Developed various PID control systems
* Electronics
* Some experience in machine learning, data/sensor fusion
* Various hardware related skills, CAD (Creo), and electronics software (Multisim, hspice, Orcad)
* ECAD for PCB (KiCad), Learning VLSI
