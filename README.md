# Welcome to my page

## Intro
I am Jonathon, and I am an electrical engineering student who is trying to get his hands on practical projects that involve embedded computers and their applications. I hope to learn more about wireless communication, sensor fusion, machine learning, solving inverse problems, etc.

## Contact
I do not currently have a lot of time on my hands, but if you are interested in collaborating feel free to contact me at jonathonkberg@gmail.com.
