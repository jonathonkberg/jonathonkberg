# Welcome to my page

## Intro
I am Jonathon, and I am an electrical engineering student who is trying to get his hands on practical projects that involve embedded computers and their applications. I am interested in control systems and the intersection between electrical engineering and computer science, and I hope to learn more about wireless communication, sensor fusion, machine learning, and solving inverse problems.

## Skills
* Some experience C/C++, Matlab, python, LabView
* Have worked with: esp8266/32, arduino, Risc-V dev board
* Some experience in machine learning, data/sensor fusion, machine vision
* Various hardware related skills, CAD, and electriconics software

## Some current interests
Currently, I am trying to develop the following skills:
* Developing more sophisticated code for chips (avr, pic, etc.)
* Become comfortable with wireless protocals (TCP/IP, LORA, etc.)
* Utilizing FPGA for process acceleration (and more about ASICs)
* Understanding file structures better
* Become comfortable using more complicated variable types
* Embedded device and cloud interface (and utilizing Azure)

## Contact
I do not currently have a lot of time on my hands with my current private projects and endeavors, but if you are interested in collaborating feel free to contact me at jonathonkberg@gmail.com.
